# Surf Data Analysis

This repo is used to analyize and visualize my personal surf data, where I have recorded every surf session since february of 2017. 
As of July 2025, there over 1500 surf sessions recorded.

# To Do
- [ ] Add in annual summaries; counts of sessions, boards, barrels, top 5 spots, etc. per year
    - build this into an Adobe After Effects workflow which spits out a yearly "Surfing Wrapped" with data behind animations
- [ ] Add in spot analysis; for certain sessions that were labeled 'good' (wave quality > 9), what NOAA conditions were present?
- [ ] Add in regional analysis; timeline of regions surfed per month over all years and difference in surf time per region
- [ ] Add in wetsuit analysis; how long does a wetsuit last?
- [ ] Rebuild geospatial analysis - add dots around the globe and then focus on spots in california 

# Updates
